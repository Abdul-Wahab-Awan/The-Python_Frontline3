#Basic Concept

# each other then we use those operator mean we do comparison b/w them
""""There is well knowed Ascii Code Table it used to calculate which string value is much greater than
the other it work like this
a=65
b=66 
c=67
mean every single alphabet has its own number it calculate every single alphabet 
by using Asci code table

#like we want to Upper the string
